# NEW ENGINEERING TOOL IN PREDICTION OF SOUND TRANSMISSION LOSS


The goal of the program is to provide a quick comparison between the sound transmission loss of different panel configurations, including double leaf elements and sandwich panels. The program makes a use of a variety of accessible formulas to estimate the transmission loss and to detect changes in the curve due to structural modifications, with a user-friendly interface at the same time. By providing geometry, panel configuration and material properties as the input, a transmission loss plot over a third band frequency range can be obtained. 

The program interface consists of two tabs and one graph. The first tab contains two sections:  a double leaf element and a sandwich panel, respectively. The second tab is for the single plate section only. The double leaf element section includes three panel configurations: unconnected panels, panels with line connections and panels with point connections. The main comparison can be made within tab 1, by comparing the double leaf element and the sandwich panel cases. The single plate section is an add-on to the comparison feature of the program.
